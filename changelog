      Creating the CordovaWebView, modifying DroidGap to use that
      Adding the tests from the GitHub Prototype
      Cleaning out the asssets/www directory.  This should house mobile-spec

      Moving whitelisting into the WebView, still need to read the config in the WebView if required

      Tweaking DroidGap so it compiles into a JAR, starting testing
